This app is for the author David Rigtrup.

It is a space for him to communicate with fans and to give updates on current books or anything else he wishes to share.
All the blog posts and character bios are saved in a database.

The contact form utilizes nodemailer making it possible for fans to ask David questions or give feedback.

The login is primarily for David as it allows extra features for him.
Anyone is able to go to the "hidden" urls, but only admins can submit the changes.
